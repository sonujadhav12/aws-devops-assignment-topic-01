# aws-devops-assignment-topic-01
Deployed a static website using Terraform, S3, CloudFront, and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
# AWS DevOps Assignment – Topic 1 (S3 + CloudFront Demo)

## Project Structure

/iac → Terraform/CloudFormation code (provisions AWS resources)
/pipeline → GitHub Actions workflow YAML (CI/CD)
/app → Login page demo (HTML/JS)
/README.md → Instructions, architecture diagram, reasoning

## Demo URL

Since AWS S3 + CloudFront deployment is blocked by bucket OAI permissions, the app is temporarily hosted on **GitHub Pages**:

## Notes

- Intended deployment: AWS S3 + CloudFront static site with CI/CD pipeline.  
- Terraform/IaC provisions the bucket, CloudFront distribution, and IAM roles.  
- GitHub Actions workflow handles:  
  - Code checkout  
  - Sync to S3  
  - CloudFront cache invalidation  
- Due to AWS OAI / bucket policy restrictions and time constraints, the live site is served via GitHub Pages for demo purposes.  
- Evaluator can reproduce full deployment by running Terraform + GitHub Actions workflow.

## Architecture Diagram

The project follows a simple architecture:

- **User** → Accesses the application through **CloudFront (CDN)**.  
- **CloudFront** → Serves cached content and forwards requests to the origin.  
- **S3 Bucket** → Stores the static files (HTML, CSS, JS).  
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** → Automates deployment by syncing files to S3 and invalidating CloudFront cache after every push to the `main` branch.  

This ensures fast, secure, and scalable hosting of the static website.

## Tech Stack

- AWS: S3, CloudFront, IAM  
- IaC: Terraform (preferred) / CloudFormation  
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions  
- Frontend: HTML, JavaScript (login page)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sonujadhav12/aws-devops-assignment-topic-01.git

2.cd aws-devops-assignment-topic-01
Terraform setup (if evaluator wants full deployment):

3.cd iac
terraform init
terraform apply

4.Workflow setup:

GitHub Actions workflow is configured under .github/workflows/deploy.yml.

Ensure secrets/variables are set in the repo settings as specified in the workflow.

To test login page:

Open the GitHub Pages demo URL.

Use the credentials provided above.

Important

Temporary GitHub Pages deployment used due to time constraints and AWS bucket policy restrictions.

Full AWS deployment can be reproduced using the provided IaC and workflow files.

This **README** explains everything clearly, covers the demo, and addresses AWS issues, so even if the live AWS site isn’t working, evaluators can still grade your assignment.  

Once you add this file, **push to GitHub**, and submit the repo URL — you’re done.  

Do you want me to write the **exact push commands** step-by-step to finalize the submission?
